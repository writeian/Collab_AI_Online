## 📋 Branches

- **Development**: `dev`
- **Production**: whichever branch your **Railway** service is connected to (check *Settings → Source* in the Railway dashboard). Teams often use `feature/railway-deployment` or a long-lived feature branch such as `updated-edu-tools`—this repo does not enforce a single production branch name in code.

### How to deploy to Railway
- Check out the branch Railway is tracking, then push:
  ```bash
  git checkout <your-railway-branch> && git pull --ff-only
  git commit -m "deploy: your summary here"
  git push origin <your-railway-branch>
  ```
- After deploy, hard refresh the browser to bypass cached static assets (many files use `?v=` cache busters).

- Google Cloud Project (for Google Docs integration)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/writeian/Collab_AI_Online.git
cd Collab_AI_Online

# Create virtual environment (repo docs also use .venv — either name is fine)
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables (canonical template in repo root)
cp env_template.txt .env
# Edit .env — see “Environment Variables” above and SETUP_LOCAL.md

# Apply DB migrations, then run
alembic upgrade head
python run.py
```

*(For a shorter local checklist, see [SETUP_LOCAL.md](SETUP_LOCAL.md).)*

---

## 🔧 Development

### Code Quality
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Type checking with mypy
python -m mypy src/app/ --ignore-missing-imports

# Linting with flake8
python -m flake8 src/ --max-line-length=120
```

### macOS Case Sensitivity Note
**For macOS developers**: Due to the default case-insensitive filesystem, the `templates/` directory may appear in your IDE or terminal as both `templates/` and `Templates/`. These are the same directory. Always reference `templates/` (lowercase) in code and documentation, as that's what Git tracks and what production uses.

## 🚀 Deployment

### Railway Deployment
1. **Connect Repository**: Link this GitHub repo to your Railway project
2. **Start Command**: `gunicorn wsgi:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 2 --timeout 120` (already in `railway.toml`)
3. **Healthcheck**: `/health` (already in `railway.toml`)
4. **Environment Variables**: Set `SECRET_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, `REFINE_V2_ENABLED`, `AI_FAILOVER_ORDER`, `ANTHROPIC_MODEL/OPENAI_MODEL` as needed
5. **Database**: Use PostgreSQL for production. Run migrations: `alembic upgrade head`
6. **Endpoint Name**: Set a friendly slug in Service → Networking (globally unique)
7. **Deploy**: Deploy from the UI or by pushing to your deployment branch

**📖 [Complete Railway Deployment Guide](RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md)**

### Digital Ocean Deployment
```bash
# Run automated deployment script
bash deployment/deploy.sh
```

### Manual Deployment
```bash
# Install production dependencies
pip install -r requirements_production.txt

# Set production environment variables
export FLASK_ENV=production
export DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_url

# Run migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Start production server (from repo root; see wsgi.py)
gunicorn wsgi:app
```

### Custom Domains (Railway)
- Recommended: add a subdomain like `app.yourdomain.com`
- Create a CNAME to your `*.up.railway.app` endpoint, verify in Railway Networking
- If verification fails, ensure DNS is set to DNS-only during initial verification and try again

---

## 🧪 Trial Mode (Optional/Future)

Offer limited, server-enforced guest trials (e.g., 1 room, 1 chat, 6 messages) without registration, with a clean upgrade path to a full account.

- Design doc: `docs/trial_sessions_option_2.md`
- Highlights: DB-backed counters, expiry/cleanup, adoption on signup, and abuse safeguards

---

## 🛟 Troubleshooting

- Anthropic 529 (service overloaded):
  - The app retries briefly and falls back to goal‑aware templates. Check Anthropic status and org limits.
  - Ensure `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set on the correct service and org.

- Endpoint slug errors (Railway): endpoint names are globally unique. Try a different slug (Service → Networking → Endpoint name)
- Custom domains: add CNAME to your service’s `*.up.railway.app`; if using Cloudflare, set DNS-only during verification
- Static asset 404s on Linux: ensure case-sensitive paths (e.g., `Static/` vs `static/`)
- JSON POSTs and CSRF: app includes a global fetch wrapper that sends `X-CSRFToken` automatically

**Type Coverage**: A large share of the codebase uses type hints; run `mypy` in CI/local dev for current status.

## Recent Updates (2026)

### Collaboration & chat polish
- **Participant presence**: heartbeats per room/chat for “who’s active” in the sidebar; fixes ensure **room owners** are included in presence the same as `RoomMember` rows
- **Presence + CSRF**: client uses the correct chat id and cookie-based CSRF for ping endpoints
- **Busy chat**: when active count crosses above five (same chat when presence includes `chat_id`), response length auto-switches to **Short** once per spike (overridable in Tone & Length)
- **Tone & Length UX**: inline tips replaced with `?` help; tooltips are **portaled to `document.body`** so they render above the main chat (sidebar `backdrop-filter` / overflow no longer clip them)

---

## Recent Updates (Oct-Nov 2025)

### Sidebar Overhaul (Phases 1-3)
- **Collapsible sections**: Tools, Participants, Other Chats with smart defaults
- **Unified tool cards**: Learning Progress, Tone & Length, Document Generation
- **Dynamic dashboard**: Tools summary shows current tone and progress status at a glance
- **Professional polish**: Lucide icons, 8pt spacing rhythm, accessible ARIA patterns
- **Mobile optimized**: Scrollable drawer, 44px tap targets, responsive spacing

### Performance & UX
- **Adaptive polling**: 5s when active, 90s when idle; auto-wake on new messages
- **iPhone scroll fixed**: Native iOS behavior, no scroll traps
- **External JS architecture**: -815 lines of inline code removed
- **Clean console**: All accessibility and integration issues resolved

See `docs/SESSION-SUMMARY-2025-10-28.md` and `docs/PHASE3-tool-header-alignment.md` for complete details.
