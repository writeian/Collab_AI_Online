- Write in a clear, engaging style appropriate for educational purposes
- Focus on conceptual understanding rather than just facts

STRICT CONTEXT BOUNDARY:
{context_instruction}

{context_section}

TASK:
Create an interactive narrative where the learner makes choices that affect the story. The narrative should:
- Help students understand key concepts from the materials through interactive storytelling
- Present decision points that connect to course concepts
- Show consequences of different choices
- Have multiple possible endings based on different choice paths
- Be grounded entirely in the provided context materials

COMPLEXITY LEVEL: {complexity.upper()}
- Choices per decision point: {constraints['choices_per_node']}
- Minimum total length: {constraints['min_chars']} characters across ALL nodes
- Minimum number of nodes: {constraints['min_nodes']} nodes (including start and endings)
- Minimum content per node: {constraints['min_chars_per_node']} characters
- Style: {constraints['description']}
- Story depth: More complex = deeper story with more interconnected decision points and longer content

INTERACTIVE NARRATIVE STRUCTURE:
- Start with an initial node that sets up the story (at least {constraints['min_chars_per_node']} characters)
- CRITICAL: Create AT LEAST {constraints['min_nodes']} total nodes to ensure sufficient depth and complexity
- IMPORTANT: Count your nodes carefully - you need {constraints['min_nodes']} nodes minimum (including start node and all endings)
- Each node (except endings) must have exactly {constraints['choices_per_node']} choices
- Choices should connect to concepts from the course materials and present meaningful dilemmas
- Create multiple interconnected paths that lead to different endings (at least 3-4 different endings for Challenge, 2-3 for others)
- Each ending should reflect different outcomes based on choices made and be substantial (at least {constraints['min_chars_per_node']} characters)
- The total narrative should be at least {constraints['min_chars']} characters across all nodes
- For Challenge level: Create deeper branching with 3-4 decision points before reaching endings, showing how early choices affect later outcomes
- TIP: To reach {constraints['min_nodes']} nodes, plan your structure: 1 start + multiple decision nodes + multiple endings = {constraints['min_nodes']}+ total

NODE REQUIREMENTS:
- Each node must have: id, content (story text), choices array, isEnding flag
- Each choice must have: id, text (choice description), nextNode (id of next node)
- Ending nodes have empty choices array and isEnding: true
- Content should be substantial (minimum {constraints['min_chars_per_node']} characters per node) to advance the story meaningfully
- Choices should be meaningful, present real dilemmas, and connect to course concepts
- For Challenge level: Choices should present conflicting goals where no option is clearly "best"
- Each node's content should be rich enough to immerse the learner in the scenario

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):
{{

      "isEnding": true
    }}
  ],
  "startNodeId": "start"
}}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Generate the COMPLETE narrative tree upfront (all nodes, all paths, all endings)
- NODE COUNT: Create AT LEAST {constraints['min_nodes']} total nodes (this is mandatory - count them before responding!)
- To reach {constraints['min_nodes']} nodes: Plan 1 start node + multiple decision nodes (each with {constraints['choices_per_node']} choices) + multiple endings
- Example structure for {constraints['min_nodes']} nodes: Start (1) → Decision nodes (6-8) → Endings (3-4) = {constraints['min_nodes']}+ total
- Ensure minimum character count of {constraints['min_chars']} characters total across ALL nodes
- Each non-ending node must have exactly {constraints['choices_per_node']} choices
- Each node's content must be at least {constraints['min_chars_per_node']} characters (longer is better, especially for Challenge level)
- Create multiple endings: at least 3-4 different endings for Challenge level, 2-3 for Simulation, 2 for Explanation
- For Challenge level: Ensure there are multiple decision points (at least 3-4 choices before reaching any ending) to show how decisions compound
- All content must be grounded in the provided context materials
- For Challenge level: Make choices more nuanced - avoid obvious "good vs bad" options; instead present trade-offs where each choice has meaningful consequences

NODE REFERENCE VALIDATION:
- EVERY choice's "nextNode" field MUST reference a node ID that exists in your "nodes" array
- Before finalizing your response, verify that every "nextNode" value matches an actual node "id"
- Do NOT create choices that reference nodes that don't exist
- All node IDs must be unique strings (use descriptive names like "node1", "ending1", "path_a", etc.)
- The "startNodeId" must match one of the node IDs in your "nodes" array

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):
{{
  "nodes": [
    {{
      "id": "start",
      "content": "Story text that sets up the scenario...",

      "content": "Ending text based on path taken...",
      "choices": [],
      "isEnding": true
    }}
  ],
  "startNodeId": "start"
}}

VALIDATION CHECKLIST (verify before responding):
1. All node IDs are unique
2. Every "nextNode" in choices references an existing node ID
3. "startNodeId" exists in the nodes array
4. Total number of nodes is at least {constraints['min_nodes']}
5. All non-ending nodes have exactly {constraints['choices_per_node']} choices
6. All ending nodes have empty choices arrays and isEnding: true
7. Each node's content is at least {constraints['min_chars_per_node']} characters
8. Total content length meets minimum of {constraints['min_chars']} characters across all nodes
9. For Challenge level: There are at least 3-4 decision points (non-ending nodes) before reaching any ending
10. Multiple endings exist (3-4 for Challenge, 2-3 for Simulation, 2 for Explanation)

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:
Return ONLY valid JSON. Do NOT include any explanatory text, comments, discussion, or other content.
- Start your response immediately with an opening brace
- End your response with a closing brace
- Do NOT write "I understand" or any other text before the JSON
- Do NOT write explanations or comments after the JSON
- Your entire response must be a single, valid JSON object

Return ONLY valid JSON, no additional text before or after"""

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT:
- You MUST return ONLY valid JSON. Do NOT include any explanatory text, comments, or discussion before or after the JSON.
- Do NOT write "I understand the task" or any other text. Start your response immediately with {{ and end with }}.
- Your entire response must be a single, valid JSON object matching the specified format.

CRITICAL VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
1. FIRST: Create ALL nodes with unique IDs before writing any choices
2. THEN: Write choices, ensuring every "nextNode" references an EXISTING node ID from your nodes list
3. VERIFY: Before responding, check that every "nextNode" in every choice matches an actual node "id" exactly
4. The "startNodeId" must match one of your node IDs exactly
5. CRITICAL: Total content must be at least {constraints['min_chars']} characters across ALL nodes (acceptable minimum: {int(constraints['min_chars'] * 0.75)})
6. CRITICAL: You must create at least {constraints['min_nodes']} total nodes (acceptable minimum: {max(3, int(constraints['min_nodes'] * 0.7))})
7. Each node must have at least {constraints['min_chars_per_node']} characters of content (acceptable minimum: {int(constraints['min_chars_per_node'] * 0.7)})

STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS:
Step 1: Plan your narrative structure to meet ALL requirements (nodes, character counts, complexity)
Step 2: Create ALL nodes with unique IDs and substantial content
Step 3: Add choices to each node, referencing ONLY existing node IDs
Step 4: Verify all requirements are met (character count, node count, references)
Step 5: Return ONLY the JSON object - no other text

Return ONLY valid JSON that passes these validation checks. Double-check all requirements before responding.""",
